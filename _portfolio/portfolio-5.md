I study the build-up of precedent in the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Applying a machine learning framework, I find that legal and political factors explain why the CJEU draws upon some of its earlier judgments again and again, while others not never revisited. The results have important implications for the scholarly debates on the European Union and legal integration by international courts.
