We conduct a cross-national study on affective polarization, focusing on the United States and 25 European democracies. Utilizing dictator and trust games in a novel research design, we measure the partisan divide's extent and nature. Findings reveal that partisanship significantly surpasses other social divides in almost all democracies, confirming its primacy. Unlike the U.S., European affective polarization is not predominantly driven by out-group animosity but equally by in-group favoritism. Notably, coalition partnerships among political parties significantly reduce polarization, emphasizing their role in shaping the dynamics of affective polarization across diverse democracies.
