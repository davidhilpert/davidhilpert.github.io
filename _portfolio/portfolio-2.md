This article investigates the public reaction to EU preferential trade agreement negotiations, focusing on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). Despite potential benefits, these negotiations faced widespread protests, challenging the common expectation of positive public response. The paper explores the role of transparency in shaping public evaluations of these agreements, conducting a randomized survey experiment in the German Internet Panel (GIP), representative of the adult population in Germany. The findings indicate that non-transparency negatively affects public support for trade agreements, extending beyond trade to environmental agreements. The study highlights the impact of the political process, emphasizing the need for transparency in decision-making to garner public support.
