This article examines the politicization of European integration since the Maastricht Treaty and its impact on party competition, elections, and public discourse in Europe. The study addresses the emergence of a new cleavage, distinct from the traditional left–right dimension, referred to as transnational integration–demarcation. Focusing on affective polarization and social identity theories, the research employs a large-scale survey experiment across 25 EU member states. By using dictator games, the study measures bias generated by European identity, revealing a significant and substantial divide driven more by out-group animosity than in-group favoritism.

The study emphasizes the role of elections and campaigns in shaping political identities and conflicts, with political parties and actors contributing to activating these identities. Elite polarization and the influence of Eurosceptic parties are highlighted as intensifying the divide over European identity, especially in high-stake electoral contexts. The findings contribute to understanding the microfoundations of the political divide over European integration and extend theories of social identity and affective polarization in the context of EU politics.
