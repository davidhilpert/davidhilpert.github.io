I am data scientist at the [FUNKE Mediengruppe](https://www.funkemedien.de/de/). Previously, I worked as a researcher at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/gess/), where I earned a PhD in Political Science. In my [doctoral thesis](https://madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/63025/) I employed strategic models to study state litigation at the Court of Justice of the European Union, while my research interests also cover the everyday decision-making of ordinary people. My research has been published at renowned peer-reviewed journals. Methodologically, I am interested in text-as-data and NLP, machine learning, and causal inference.
