I am data scientist at the [FUNKE Mediengruppe](https://www.funkemedien.de/de/). Previously, I worked as a researcher at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/gess/), where I earned a PhD in Political Science. In my [doctoral thesis](https://madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/63025/) I employed strategic models to study state litigation at the Court of Justice of the European Union, while my research interests also cover the everyday decision-making of ordinary people. My research has been published at peer-reviewed journals, such as the [American Political Science Review](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/B46AE5A929EA42FE817FE6273B0243E8/S0003055423000266a.pdf/div-class-title-divided-we-unite-the-nature-of-partyism-and-the-role-of-coalition-partnership-in-europe-div.pdf) and the [European Journal of Political Research](https://scholar.google.de/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=de&user=RkCa68wAAAAJ&citation_for_view=RkCa68wAAAAJ:qjMakFHDy7sC). Methodologically, I am interested in text-as-data and NLP, machine learning, and causal inference.
